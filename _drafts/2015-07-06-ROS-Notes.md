>**NOTE**I developed this note while I was learning ROS the hard way, i.e., coding and searching through [ros answers](http://answers.ros.org/questions) whenever I hit a brick. You would find some lines that are duplicated on the [ros wiki pages](http://wiki.ros.org/) but this is meant to give you a brief and hit and run overview of ROS if you are new to the ROS environment. Most of these instructions are only useful if you are running Linux as I do most of my coding in sublime-text2 on Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (Ubuntu trusty).

The most common way of starting a roscpp node is by creating a `ros::NodeHandle`:

   <pre class="terminal"><code>$ ros::NodeHandle nh; </code></pre>

When the first `ros::NodeHandle` is created it will call `ros::start()`, and when the last `ros::NodeHandle` is destroyed, it will call `ros::shutdown()`. If you want to manually manage the lifetime of the node you may call `ros::start()` yourself, in which case you should call `ros::shutdown()` before your program exits.

###Shutting Down the Node
At any time you may call the `ros::shutdown()` function to shutdown your node. This will kill all open subscriptions, publications, service calls, and service servers.

By default `roscpp` also installs a `SIGINT` handler which will detect Ctrl-C and automatically shutdown for you.

**Testing for Shutdown**
There are two methods to check for various states of shutdown. The most common is `ros::ok()`. Once `ros::ok()` returns false, the node has finished shutting down. A common use of `ros::ok():`

```c++
    while (ros::ok())
      {
        ...
      }
```

The other method to check for shutdown is the `ros::isShuttingDown()` method. This method will turn true as soon as `ros::shutdown()` is called, not when it is done. Use of `ros::isShuttingDown()` is generally discouraged, but can be useful in advanced cases. For example, to test inside of a prolonged service callback whether the node is requested to shut down and the callback should therefore quit now, `ros::isShuttingDown()` is needed. `ros::ok()` would not work here because the node can't finish its shutdown as long as the callback is running.

####Custom SIGINT Handler

You can install a custom **SIGINT** handler that plays nice with ROS like so:

```c++
  #include <ros/ros.h>
  #include <signal.h>
   
  void mySigintHandler(int sig)
   {
      // Do some custom action.
      // For example, publish a stop message to some other nodes.
      
      // All the default sigint handler does is call shutdown()
     ros::shutdown();
   }
   
   int main(int argc, char** argv)
   {
     ros::init(argc, argv, "my_node_name");
     ros::NodeHandle nh;
   
     // Override the default ros sigint handler.
     // This must be set after the first NodeHandle is created.
     signal(SIGINT, mySigintHandler);
     
     //...
     ros::spin();
     return 0;
   }
  ```

  `roscpp` provides some built-in support for calling callbacks from multiple threads. There are two built-in options for this:

>ros::MultiThreadedSpinner

`MultiThreadedSpinner` is a blocking spinner, similar to `ros::spin()`. You can specify a number of threads in its constructor, 
but if unspecified (or set to 0), it will use a thread for each CPU core.

```c++
   ros::MultiThreadedSpinner spinner(4); // Use 4 threads
   spinner.spin(); // spin() will not return until the node has been shutdown
    
   ros::AsyncSpinner (new in 0.10)
```

A more useful threaded spinner is the AsyncSpinner. Instead of a blocking spin() call, it has start() and stop() calls, 
and will automatically stop when it is destroyed. An equivalent use of AsyncSpinner to the MultiThreadedSpinner example above, is:
```c++
   1 ros::AsyncSpinner spinner(4); // Use 4 threads
   2 spinner.start();
   3 ros::waitForShutdown();
```

   [Publishing Images](http://wiki.ros.org/image_transport/Tutorials/PublishingImages)
   ```c++
   #include <ros/ros.h>
   #include <image_transport/image_transport.h>
   #include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
   #include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>
    
   int main(int argc, char** argv)
   {
      ros::init(argc, argv, "image_publisher");
      ros::NodeHandle nh;
     image_transport::ImageTransport it(nh);
     image_transport::Publisher pub = it.advertise("camera/image", 1);
     cv::Mat image = cv::imread(argv[1], CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR);
     cv::waitKey(30);
     sensor_msgs::ImagePtr msg = cv_bridge::CvImage(std_msgs::Header(), "bgr8", image).toImageMsg(); /**We load a user-specified
   (on the command line) color image from disk using OpenCV, then convert it to the ROS type sensor_msgs/Image.**/
   
     ros::Rate loop_rate(5);
     while (nh.ok()) {
       pub.publish(msg);    /*We broadcast the image to anyone connected to one of our topics, 
                                exactly as we would have using a ros::Publisher.*/
       ros::spinOnce();
       loop_rate.sleep();
     }
   }
  ```

**Adding video stream from a webcam**

The example above requires a path of an image file to be added as a command line parameter
```c++ 
cv::imread(argv[1], 
  CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR) 
  ```. 
  This image will be converted and send as a message to an image subscriber. In most cases 
however this is not a very practical example since often you are required to handle streaming data 
(for example: multiple webcameras mounted on a robot record the scene around it and you have to pass the image date 
  to some other node for further analysis). You can modify the example quite easily to make it work with a video device 
supported by `cv::VideoCapture` (in case it is not you have to handle it accordingly):

```c++
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <image_transport/image_transport.h>
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>
#include <sstream> // for converting the command line parameter to integer

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  // Check if video source has been passed as a parameter
  if(argv[1] == NULL) return 1;

  ros::init(argc, argv, "image_publisher");
  ros::NodeHandle nh;
  image_transport::ImageTransport it(nh);
  image_transport::Publisher pub = it.advertise("camera/image", 1);

  // Convert the passed as command line parameter index for the video device to an integer
  std::istringstream video_sourceCmd(argv[1]);
  int video_source;
  // Check if it is indeed a number
  if(!(video_sourceCmd >> video_source)) return 1;

  cv::VideoCapture cap(video_source);
  // Check if video device can be opened with the given index
  if(!cap.isOpened()) return 1;
  cv::Mat frame;
  sensor_msgs::ImagePtr msg;

  ros::Rate loop_rate(5);
  while (nh.ok()) {
    cap >> frame;
    // Check if grabbed frame is actually full with some content
    if(!frame.empty()) {
      msg = cv_bridge::CvImage(std_msgs::Header(), "bgr8", frame).toImageMsg();
      pub.publish(msg);
      cv::waitKey(1);
    }

    ros::spinOnce();
    loop_rate.sleep();
  }
}
```

```c++
/**Writing a Simple Image Subscriber**/
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <image_transport/image_transport.h>  //image_transport/image_transport.h includes everything we need to publish and subscribe to images.
#include <opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp>
#include <cv_bridge/cv_bridge.h>
//These headers will allow us to display images using OpenCV's simple GUI capabilities.

void imageCallback(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg)  //This is the callback function that will get called when a new image has arrived on the "camera/image" topic
{
  try
  {
    cv::imshow("view", cv_bridge::toCvShare(msg, "bgr8")->image);
    cv::waitKey(30);
  }
  catch (cv_bridge::Exception& e)
  {
    ROS_ERROR("Could not convert from '%s' to 'bgr8'.", msg->encoding.c_str());
  }
  /*The body of the callback. We convert the ROS image message to an OpenCV image 
  with BGR pixel encoding, then show it in a display window. */
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ros::init(argc, argv, "image_listener");
  ros::NodeHandle nh;
  cv::namedWindow("view");    //Create an OpenCV display window.
  cv::startWindowThread();  //We create an ImageTransport instance, initializing it with our NodeHandle. 
  image_transport::ImageTransport it(nh);  //We use methods of ImageTransport to create image publishers and subscribers,
  ros::spin();
  cv::destroyWindow("view");
}
```


###Converting ROS image messages to OpenCV images
CvBridge defines a CvImage type containing an OpenCV image, its encoding and a ROS header. CvImage contains exactly the 
information sensor_msgs/Image does, so we can convert either representation to the other. CvImage class format:

```c++
namespace cv_bridge {

class CvImage
{
public:
  std_msgs::Header header;
  std::string encoding;
  cv::Mat image;
};

typedef boost::shared_ptr<CvImage> CvImagePtr;
typedef boost::shared_ptr<CvImage const> CvImageConstPtr;

}

/************************************************************************************************************
*When converting a ROS sensor_msgs/Image message into a CvImage, CvBridge recognizes two distinct use cases:
*
*We want to modify the data in-place. We have to make a copy of the ROS message data.
*We won't modify the data. We can safely share the data owned by the ROS message instead of copying.
*CvBridge provides the following functions for converting to CvImage:
*************************************************************************************************************/

// Case 1: Always copy, returning a mutable CvImage
CvImagePtr toCvCopy(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& source,
                    const std::string& encoding = std::string());
CvImagePtr toCvCopy(const sensor_msgs::Image& source,
                    const std::string& encoding = std::string());

// Case 2: Share if possible, returning a const CvImage
CvImageConstPtr toCvShare(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& source,
                          const std::string& encoding = std::string());
CvImageConstPtr toCvShare(const sensor_msgs::Image& source,
                          const boost::shared_ptr<void const>& tracked_object,
                          const std::string& encoding = std::string());

/******Converting OpenCV images to ROS image messages******/
//To convert a CvImage into a ROS image message, use one the toImageMsg() member function:


class CvImage
{
  sensor_msgs::ImagePtr toImageMsg() const;

  // Overload mainly intended for aggregate messages that contain
  // a sensor_msgs::Image as a member.
  void toImageMsg(sensor_msgs::Image& ros_image) const;
};

/***Image Transport**************************************************************************
*image_transport should always be used to publish and subscribe to images. 
*At this basic level of usage, it is very similar to using ROS Publishers and Subscribers. 
*Using image_transport instead of the ROS primitives, however, gives you great flexibility in 
*how images are communicated between nodes.
*
*
***********************************************************************************************/
// Use the image_transport classes instead.
//Instead of:
// Do not communicate images this way!
#include <ros/ros.h>

void imageCallback(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg)
{
  // ...
}

ros::NodeHandle nh;
ros::Subscriber sub = nh.subscribe("in_image_topic", 1, imageCallback);
ros::Publisher pub = nh.advertise<sensor_msgs::Image>("out_image_topic", 1);


//Do
// Use the image_transport classes instead.
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <image_transport/image_transport.h>

void imageCallback(const sensor_msgs::ImageConstPtr& msg)
{
  // ...
}

ros::NodeHandle nh;
image_transport::ImageTransport it(nh);
image_transport::Subscriber sub = it.subscribe("in_image_base_topic", 1, imageCallback);
image_transport::Publisher pub = it.advertise("out_image_base_topic", 1);
