This post includes curated links to advice on doing good research from people I respect.

  >**Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition. Therefore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but the simplest formulas are replaced by ``blah" or some other grunting noise.**

    > **Sometimes it’s useful to think that everyone else is an idiot. This lets you do things that no one else is doing. It’s best not to be too vocal about that. You can say something like “Oh, I just thought I’d try out this direction”**

  > **I think the most important thing in
research is a story -- not a theorem or an
algorithm -- but the story that makes the
theorem or algorithm interesting and
exciting.   It’s important to have an "ear"
for a good story... when do the stories
make sense, when are they bogus? ~ Tomas Lozano-Perez**.

> **The best students are possessed by a problem. They're independent. They
teach their advisors. They don't do what they're told...they do something more
interesting.The ~ Leslie Kaelbling **

> **Don't tell your advisor you're doing what
they advised against until you’ve solved the
problem. ~ Manolis Kellis **

> ** Which brings us to the moral of the story: More important than your thesis topic is who your advisor is. ~ Charles Leiserson  **

> ** Eat, sleep, and breathe a problem until you
crack it. Become the world’s foremost expert on your
thesis topic. Surpass your advisor.  ~ Daniel Jackson **
