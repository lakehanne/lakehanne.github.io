This post includes curated links to advice on doing good research from people I respect.

I hope you find time to enjoy reading them.

+ [How to write a good research paper ~ Bill Freiman](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/citizenofcvpr/static/slides/freeman_how_to_write_papers.pdf)

  > Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition. Therefore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but the simplest formulas are replaced by "blah" or some other grunting noise.

    > Sometimes it’s useful to think that everyone else is an idiot. This lets you do things that no one else is doing. It’s best not to be too vocal about that. You can say something like “Oh, I just thought I’d try out this direction”

    > I think the most important thing in research is a story -- not a theorem or an algorithm -- but the story that makes the theorem or algorithm interesting and exciting.   It’s important to have an "ear" for a good story... when do the stories make sense, when are they bogus? ~ Tomas Lozano-Perez.

    > The best students are possessed by a problem. They're independent. They teach their advisors. They don't do what they're told...they do something more interesting.The ~ Leslie Kaelbling**

    > Don't tell your advisor you're doing what they advised against until you’ve solved the problem. ~ Manolis Kellis

    > Which brings us to the moral of the story: More important than your thesis topic is who your advisor is. ~ Charles Leiserson  

    > ** Eat, sleep, and breathe a problem until you crack it. Become the world’s foremost expert on your thesis topic. Surpass your advisor.  ~ Daniel Jackson **

+ [On how to write papers, Ted Adelson](http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.899/papers/ted.htm)
    >  Start by stating which problem you are addressing, keeping the audience in mind.  They must care about it, which means that sometimes you must tell them why they should care about the problem.  Then state briefly what the other solutions are to the problem, and why they aren't satisfactory.  If they were satisfactory, you wouldn't need to do the work.  Then explain your own solution, compare it with other solutions, and say why it's bettter.  At the end, talk about related work where similar techniques and experiments have been used, but applied to a different problem.  Since I developed this formula, it seems that all the papers I've written have been accepted.
