### Introduction

This post is my attempt, based on my finite experience of the past three years, to guide newly minted PhD students in their new career trajectory. You've been fortunate enough to get admitted. Congrats. How do you intend for the next five-some years to turn out? 

From day one of your PhD program, always be on the look-out for career-enhancement skills. Scour job advertorials and what's hot in your field, what skills are venture capitalists or senior tech executives emphasizing? Then build on these skills gradually and consistently. For me, it helps that I spend the first or two hours of my waking up hours reading relevant new papers and project codes on github. I have found that over time, this helps me with latent skills that are powerful and distinguishing when employers are looking for reasons to hire me over other smart students.

If you are considering the remote chance of working outside of academe, step out of your comfort zone and go for internships, even co-ops if you can handle. Figure out what research problems people are trying to solve in industry and acxademe. Oftentimes, they are so disparate. And by going to good tech companies for internships, you get to meet other top-notch grad students from other institutions around the world, develop invaluable friendships, and broaden your worldview about technology and life. Trust me, no one goes for an internship in a tech top-four and keeps the same outlook. You will have a whole new perspective about the problems you decide to spend your energy on, you will choose conferences you go to more carefully and your thoughts will become more organized around a crytallized central purpose for what you want to do with your life.

For people looking forward to an academic career and even those who are not, you should look for opportunities to present and publish your work at choice venues and societies. No matter what you think, a presentation looks great on your CV. Even better, published presentations look greater. When you write papers, write them well-ahead of conference deadline and in-situ while solving the problem at hand. Why is this? Your thoughts are well-formed about the nature of the problem, the alleys you have tried that do not work and why the existing state-of-the-art is insufficient. You can produce a better background for why your work is important while your mind is constantly trying to deconstruct a problem. When you finally have your results, the paper looks so flawless and eager to read as the flow becomes so carefully orchestrated. Give your paper to trusted colleagues within and outside of your institutions to give you their honest opinion about your paper and then send a manuscript to your advisor. For me, this is a model that works very well. 

If you can afford it, go to the premiere conferences in your field. If you do not have the money, apply to travel grants from the conference organizers or the school department to which you belong. Meeting the right people at the right time will more often than not happen at that great conference where all the rock-star professors and industry leaders attend year-in, year-out. See conferences as an occasion to get familiar with what people are doing but more importantly, as an occasion to socialize and fudge friendships that will stand the test of time.

Teaching experience is good if you intend to spend your careeer in academe. Apply to TA roles within your department. If you are very good in a subject, over time, they will offer you an instructor's role within the department. This has happend to people I know. Being a TA for a popular course is good. Being awarded your university president's teaching excellence award is better. What is supreme is teaching a course that generates a buzz in the community and interests from students from other schools.

Lastly, it does not help to look out for money. Participate in intellectually stimulating competitions that reward winners with boatloads of money. If you can fund yourself, you can do what you want within reason. Your university will be thrilled; your advcisor will be over-the-moon for you. Plus it goes on your CV. There's no loss at all. Apply to scholarships: $50 scholarships, $100 scholarships; $1000 scholarships. Why is this so? Money begets money. With scholarships, grants and fellowships, more is more. Look out for diversity scholarships if you are minority, start drafting your essay well-ahead of time. Typically, I start out two weeks before deadline iterating over my write-up several times a day. I test various words to ensure they sustain the attention and interest of the reader. WHen the final day arrives, I give it a once-over, send it to my friends in the UK to give me their honest opinion of my essay and then do the final review before submitting. This is my winning-formula. Your mileage may vary.


I have left posts below that show example applications I have written in the past that I feel might guide you in writing a coherent essay for your grant/scholarship/fellowship applications. 

Good luck, my badasses!

### NASA Application 2017

This was my application to the NASA frontier development lab last spring. The
application was well-reviewed. I was verbally offered the job but it was later
withdrawn due to reasons I still do not know all about.
