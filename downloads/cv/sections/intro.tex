\section{Statement of Goals}
% A
\cvline{}{As the gig economy evolves, automating rote tasks has taken on higher priority in business value chains. Rigid robots have played a transformative role in this economic diversification. However, rigid robots have low transportable loads, and large flexure torques which affects their accuracy. To overcome this, the joints are typically stiffened during the manufacturing process so as to minimize error magnification e.g. from shoulder out to end-effector. This  stiffening however contributes  to a high load-to-weight ratio that complicates the actuation mechanism -- hindering their use for sophisticated manipulation strategies.  In contrast, soft robots exhibit distributed deformation in their configuaration as well as bending and twisting capabilities, whilst possessing hyper-redundancy in their configuration space and flexible manipulation in delicate workspaces; their minimal resistance to applied strain and limited load-to-weight ratio make them choice mechanisms in human-safety automation domains.
%\subsection{Research Mission}
\textbf{My research goal} is to harness the capacity of soft matter for robotics,  cleverly exploiting their intrinsic morphological computation properties in order to yield simplified control laws and human-friendly robot manipulation systems. I want to continue providing robust models (via analytic and AI methods) as well as controllers for soft robots that serve as better alternatives to current rigid manipulation technologies in \bf{medicine} and \bf{industrial automation}. Therefore, I am interested in designing
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item robust models,
\item robust adaptive controllers, and
\item software frameworks
\end{inparaenum}
that make it easier (for engineers, chemists, and biologists alike) to create, test, verify and validate soft continuum manipulators as designers originally envisioned.}{}
