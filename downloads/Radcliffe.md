Over the past half century, robots have seen a a wide adoption in society. In particular, we have witnessed their wide adoption in automations tasks in traditional business value chains, which has yielded our current post-industrial economic boom. Rigid robots and traditional means of carrying out computations have played a leading role in this economic transformation. Key characteristics of rigid robots include their low transportable loads, and large flexure torques. These inherent properties affect their positioning accuracy. Therefore, to minimize positioning accuracy  e.g. error magnification from shoulder out to end-effector, their joints are typically stiffened during the manufacturing process. However, this  stiffening contributes  to a high load-to-weight ratio that complicates the overall actuation mechanism -- hindering their use in sophisticated and delicate manipulation tasks.  In contrast, soft robots exhibit distributed deformation in their configuration space as well as bending and twisting capabilities, whilst possessing hyper-redundancy and flexible manipulation capabilities in delicate workspaces. The minimal resistance of soft matter to applied strain, limited load-to-weight ratio, compliance and safety guarantees make them choice actuators in human-robot automation domains. Soft robots, composed of soft materials, can be difficult to model and control however. My goal is to harness the natural geometry soft devices, taking inspiration cues from organisms that exist in nature, and exploiting their intrinsic morphological computation properties so as to yield simplified control laws and human-friendly robot manipulation systems. I want to continue providing robust models (via analytic and AI methods) as well as controllers for soft robots that serve as better alternatives to current rigid manipulation technologies in medicine and industrial automation.  I am interested in designing robust models, robust adaptive controllers, and software frameworks that make it easier (for engineers, chemists, and biologists alike) to create, verify and validate soft continuum manipulators as designers originally envisioned. 
In the field of numerical computation, we have formalized reasoning about computational executions with clearly-defined, explicit instructions that make programming software completely deterministic. As such, automating simple tasks requires learning a haystack of programming languages and formalisms in order to formalize our thought process for silicon. Because of their superb universal approximation properties, neural networks are unreasonably efficient at drawing deductions from given examples and inductions from real-time scenarios. It stands to reason that since deduction explicates, induction would evaluate. I am envisioning a future where compuation is carried out as abstractly as humans think with the use of artificial and deep neural networks.

Humans are intelligent and not brilliant. Robots are brilliant and lack intelligence. As society becomes more industrialized, the need for automation of traditional mechanical tasks in non-traditional automation  domains are increasingly becoming clearer to engineers and scientists alike. While humans excel at reasoning while executing everyday mechanical tasks (such as pick and place, packaging of delicate items in machine assembly lines, assisting the disabled in everyday living, which reduce the occurrence of workplace accidents), robots do not. Our human motor skills, held together by millions of years of improvisation over executing tasks repeatedly, still fail us when required to carry out at precise manipulation of objects, or fast computations. Robots and mechanisms largely, on the other hand, execute pre-programmed tasks briliantly, by taking advantage of their speedy computational power, and stiff mechanical properties. However, they lack the reasoning behind such expert-driven executions that when the programs are error-prone, the execution fails catastrophically. This has been known to cause industial fatalities and autonomous car crashes etc. Therefore, it suffices to say that humans are intelligent and not brilliant and that robots are brilliant and lack intelligence. Over the chasm that yawns between the start of original life and our current individual and collective intelligence as society, we need to grace our modern brilliant robots with the intelligence that have enabled us to become skillful at executing everyday tasks across industries, living homes, and medical facilities among others with minimal errors.  The question then is how do we transfer human-level intelligence to robots such that procedural reasoning mechanical tasks that are traditionally well-executed by humans with minimal effort and long compute can be carried out by robots that inherently possess fast compute? My answer is to equip robots and mechanisms with  human-level effortless reasoning and execution, which may for example  include baking mechanical constraints into soft actuatorts, patterned after organisms that execute intelligent grasp, pick, locomotion and other manipulation tasks, found in nature. In the field of rigid robotics, for example, this could involve rethinking our way of desigining mechanical links and joints and adopting modern technology from the field of material science and engineering, or taking cues from  organisms in nature that intelligently carry out mechanical operations. In order to improvise on compute and reason, I propose using artificial neural networks as computational devices that formalize program execution since they are powerful and deduction from data and hence induction at real-time programing tasks. I am on a lifelong quest of designing soft robots and compute algorithms that are embued with bioinspired intelligence so as to make human-living a lot more comfortable. This would make traditional robots more available to a wider community of consumers, industries, medical hospitals and educational institutions and make human living more efficient.


What most appeals to you about being a Radcliffe Fellow? (max. 300 words)
=========================================================================

I consider myself an interdisciplinary researcher, who combines the elegance of control theory, machine learning, and largely computer science with the practical impact of robotics and engineering. No institution provides unparalleled match for my interdisciplinary research inquiry like Radcliffe. Given that my research is a multifaceted, Radcliffe provides an opportunity for me to engage with creative researchers in the engineering and social sciences, so that I may attain knowledge and wisdom while pursuing my intellectual and creative robots research inquiry, while shunning the glamour and fame that accompanies my prospective success. Based in Cambridge, being a Radcliffe fellow would provide an easy means of engaging with other faculties and researchers at other Greater Boston institutions such as MIT, BU and Northeastern as well as the robotics startup scene in the area. 


What would a successful year at Radcliffe look like for you? (max. 300 words)
=============================================================================


I envision my time at Radcliffe as an opportunity to engage fellow researchers, gaining new insight on solving difficult automation problems, and broadening my understanding of the problems that are important to the research community. From the rich exchange of ideas with fellows and other faculty with similar research interests, I hope to gain bleeding-edge skills for deconstructing difficult research problems; this will equip me with greater discipline capacity as I continue to hone well-rounded automation research skills. Stimulating a rapid growth in my career path, I will be equipped for bigger automation research responsibilities that positively impact the world. My contributions to the larger research community will thus become more invaluable and impactful -- improving the quality of the research ecosystem.
