I am an Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student currently focused on biomedical robots and applied control systems.

I am a part of the SeRViCE lab at UT Dallas, where I am being advised by Dr. [Nick Gans](www.utdallas.edu/~ngans). I spent the summer and fall semesters of 2017 partly in Dr. [Tyler Summer's](http://me.utdallas.edu/people/summers.html) [control, optimization, and networks lab](http://www.utdallas.edu/~tyler.summers/), where I worked on game theoretic approaches to reinforcement learning problems.

These days, I tend to spend most of my time in the [radiation oncology MAIA lab](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html) at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Here, I work on learning control problems for optimal beam angle orientation during intensity modulated cancer radiotherapy. At the MAIA lab, I am being advised by Dr. [Steve Jiang](http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html).

<!-- In 2016, I was in Amazon Robotics, North Reading, MA, where I was part of the advanced robotics lab. I worked with Dr. Andy Stubbs and Tye Brady. In a previous life, I was Prof. [Tony Dodd's](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/staff/tjd) student at the autonomous lab of Sheffield's [ACSE department](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/index). -->

My research is at the intersection of control theory and machine learning. Control theory helps me in formulating mathematical models while machine learning allows me the luxury of making sense of chaotic data in order to drive real-world processes. I try to solve problems that are difficult to model with closed-form analytic methods. I research along the lines of optimal control, adaptive neuro-dynamic systems, as well as stability and robustness of performance of dynamical systems.

This summer, I am tucked away in a research lab out in Tokyo, where I am working on the stability of nonparametric robot learning policies/controllers. My goal is to inculcate stability in the sense of Lyapunov to robot learning models, particularly imitation/reinforcement learning policies. The struggle is real!
