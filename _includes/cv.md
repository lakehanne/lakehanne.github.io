I am an Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student currently focused on biomedical robots and applied control systems.
<!-- I currently work with [Nick Gans](www.utdallas.edu/~ngans), [Steve Jiang](http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html), and [Tyler Summers](http://me.utdallas.edu/people/summers.html).  -->
My research is at the intersection of the buzzing field of machine learning, and control systems theory. Control theory helps in formulating mathematical models while machine learning allows the luxury of making sense of chaotic data in order to drive real-world control applications. I try to solve problems that are difficult to model with closed-form analytic methods. I research along the lines of optimal control, adaptive neural dynamics, stability and robustness of performance, mostly in dynamical systems.
