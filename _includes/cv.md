I am a third-year Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student currently focused on biomedical robots and applied control systems. I currently work with [Nick Gans](www.utdallas.edu/~ngans), [Steve Jiang](http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html), and [Tyler Summers](http://me.utdallas.edu/people/summers.html). My research is at the intersection of a buzzing field of learning research, machine learning, and an interesting field of systems theory, control systems. Control theory helps me in formulating mathematical models while machine learning allows me the luxury of making sense out of chaotic data in order to drive real-world control applications. I try to solve problems that are difficult to model with existing mechanical models and Newtonian methods. I research along the lines of optimal control, adaptive neural dynamics, stability and robustness of performance, mostly in dynamical systems.

<!-- ### Research Philosophy

I am a strong believer in **open science/technology** and **reproducible research**. If the problem is being avoided because it is difficult, then **you** should be the one solving it. I believe solid algorithms and codebases should be freely available to inquirers after knowledge. Open-sourcing one's code spurs force multipliers, which help get more work done _**faster and cheaper**_. To keep catastrophically good algorithms and codes more productive, one has to make them more accessible to other users and potential new developers. Therefore, I actively publish code of my works and that of others on [my github page](https://github.com/lakehanne). I am the author of [savitzky-golay](https://github.com/lakehanne/Savitzky-Golay/), [Soft-NeuroAdapt](https://github.com/lakehanne/soft-neuro-adapt), [farnn](https://github.com/lakehanne/farnn), [ensenso](https://github.com/lakehanne/ensenso) among others. Some of the projects that I have contributed to are pinned to my [github profile page](https://github.com/lakehanne.git). -->
