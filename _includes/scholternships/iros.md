I am attending IROS to present my paper with id 2181, and to learn the state-of-the-art in robotics from the best researchers on the planet. I see my attendance as an opportunity to engage fellow researchers, gaining new insight on solving difficult automation problems, and broadening my understanding of the problems that are important to the research community. From the rich exchange of ideas at the technical talks and workshops, I hope to gain cutting/bleeding-edge skills for deconstructing difficult research problems; this will equip me with greater discipline capacity as I continue to hone well-rounded friendly robots research skills. Stimulating rapid growth in my career path, I will be equipped for bigger automation research responsibilities that positively impact the world on a grand scale. My contributions to the larger robotics community will thus become more invaluable and impactful -- improving the quality of the robotics research ecosystem.
