I am attending NIPS to present my paper work: An iterative Dynamic Game Approach for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning, and to learn the state-of-the-art in neural information processing from the best researchers on the planet. I see my attendance as an opportunity to engage fellow researchers, gaining new insight on solving difficult automation/AI problems, and broadening my understanding of the problems that are important to the research community. From the rich exchange of ideas at the technical talks and workshops, I hope to gain bleeding-edge skills for deconstructing difficult research problems; this will equip me with greater discipline capacity as I continue to hone well-rounded research skills. Stimulating rapid growth in my career path, I will be equipped for bigger automation research responsibilities that positively impact the world on a grand scale. My contributions to the larger robotics and AI community will thus become more invaluable and impactful -- improving the quality of the research ecosystem in the process.

Coming from a laboratory where research funding for student travel to world-class conferences such as NIPS is almost non-existent, securing this travel grant will be a great financial relief in helping offsetting registration bills, air fare bills and hotel accommodation bills.
