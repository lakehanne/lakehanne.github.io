Hi there! I am a Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York. My work exists at the intersection of control systems, machine learning (mostly RL), and robotics -- to the end of developing principled data-driven analysis and synthesis for real-world dynamical systems.

My close collaborations currently are with [John Langford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Langford_(computer_scientist)) and [Rafah Hosn](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/raaboulh/).


#### **Old Research**

The body of my research contributions have spanned approximate dynamic programming, robust optimal control/reinforcement learning, adaptive control, and soft robot hardware design, a little flavor of computer vision and optimal state estimation, as well as robot manipulation -- which I engaged in on two internships in industry.  During my time at UChicago and Penn, I proposed a Cephalopods-inspired parallel soft robot for improving photon-based radiation therapy cancer treatments in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereo-tactic radiosurgery, and emerging magnetic resonance & linear accelerator systems. Some of these details are covered in my [Winter 2021 Johnson and Johnson Talk](/assets/presentations/AurisHealth.pdf). In essence, from 30,000ft above, this is my message: I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, developing definitions, exposition, and critical insight -- all towards real-world impactful technological solutions. I love synergizing concepts from disparate fields, and then develop algorithms and analyses which ultimately lead to the solution. The opportunity to feast on ideas -- to investigate the physics behind machines and to understand the interconnectedness of components, hear people's opinions, see their arguments' flaws, and to improvise upon them to find better solutions is an essential component of my thought-actions.


<!-- In the past, I have worked on topics spanning Nash and Saddle equilibriums in game theory; robotic manipulation with soft, semi-rigid, and rigid robots; as well as approximate dynamic programming for minimizing decision-making time for the feasible set of beam angle choices in the classic beam orientation selection problem that exists in photon-based cancer radiation therapy. -->

#### **New-ish Research Thrusts**
Nowadays, my research thrusts revolve mostly arong the arc of:

+ **Safety-critical ML**: Thinking long-term, my goal is to ensure that practical applications of sequential-decision making algorithms; reinforcement learning agents in the wild; and machine learning algorithms deployed in critical business value chains so that they return safety barrier certificates that assure real-world faults tolerance. In this sentiment, my focus is on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability theory in combination with Nagumo's theory of set invariance in assuring safety in mechanical, electrical, and software systems.

<!-- + **Digital transformation with personalized robotics**: For medical patients, particularly in radiosurgery, there is immense room for miniaturizing the design of mechanisms which can serve as assistive robots to aid patient care. Owing to the current trend, a la, open-kinematic chain-robots lacking repeatability, manufacturers for the past forty-some years have relied on leveraging rigidity of links such that the effect of maximizing errors from shoulder out to end-effector is minimized. There is no reason why robots should be bulky and noisy in the twenty-first century. With the current advancements in the theory and applications of soft and semi-rigid robots, we should be able to build personalized robots for tasks that are cost-effective while being agile. My focus is on novel sensing and devices fabrication that improve patients' experience in treatment therapy, better user experience in interactive computing, and the scaling the bleeding edge in semi-rigid devices models and control to emerging AR/VR/MR technologies.

I regularly peer-review for [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [International Federation of Automatic Control](https://www.ifac-control.org/) -- World Congress and Automatica alike, [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/),  [ICML](https://icml.cc/), IEEE Access, [Conference on Decision and Control](https://2021.ieeecdc.org/), [IROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Robots_and_Systems), [American Control Conference](https://acc2021.a2c2.org/),  ASME's [DSCC](https://event.asme.org/DSCC),  [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra), and [Neural Computing and Applications](https://www.springer.com/journal/521) among others.

Since January 2020, I have been a judge for NatGeo's [AI for Species Discovery Grant Applications](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/grants/). _This one has been on my early-stage research career bucket list since I was a PhD student: **in winter 2021, I got to serve as Associate Editor for ICRA 2021._** It was a lot of fun coordinating different discipline experts and recommending worthwhile papers tenable at the flagship robotics conference on the planet. Whew, what a multitude of projects for the salvation of robots!
