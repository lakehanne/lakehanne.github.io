Hi there! I am a Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York. My work exists at the intersection of control systems, machine learning (mostly RL), and robotics -- to the end of developing principled data-driven analysis and synthesis for real-world dynamical systems. My close collaborations currently are with [John Langford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Langford_(computer_scientist)) and [Rafah Hosn](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/raaboulh/).

In the past, I have worked on topics spanning Nash and Saddle equilibriums in game theory; robotic manipulation with soft, semi-rigid, and rigid robots; as well as approximate dynamic programming for minimizing decision-making time for the feasible set of beam angle choices in the classic beam orientation selection problem that exists in photon-based cancer radiation therapy.

Nowadays, my research thrusts revolve mostly along two major arcs viz.,

+ **Safety-critical ML**: Thinking long-term, my goal is to ensure that practical applications of sequential-decision making algorithms; reinforcement learning agents in the wild; and machine learning algorithms deployed in critical business value chains so that they return safety barrier certificates that assure real-world faults tolerance. In this sentiment, my focus is on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability theory in combination with Nagumo's theory of set invariance in assuring safety in mechanical, electrical, and software systems.

+ **Digital transformation with personalized robotics**: For medical patients, particularly in radiosurgery, there is immense room for miniaturizing the design of mechanisms which can serve as assistive robots to aid patient care. Owing to the current trend, a la, open-kinematic chain-robots lacking repeatability, manufacturers for the past forty-some years have relied on leveraging rigidity of links such that the effect of maximizing errors from shoulder out to end-effector is minimized. There is no reason why robots should be bulky and noisy in the twenty-first century. With the current advancements in the theory and applications of soft and semi-rigid robots, we should be able to build personalized robots for tasks that are cost-effective while being agile. My focus is on novel sensing and devices fabrication that improve patients' experience in treatment therapy, better user experience in interactive computing, and the scaling the bleeding edge in semi-rigid devices models and control to emerging AR/VR/MR technologies.
