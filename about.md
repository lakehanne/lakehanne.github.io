### Intro blah, blah, blah.

<!-- #### Tell me what you got -->

Welcome to my web presence, where theory meets practice, and where scientific elegance meets practical impact. Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, game theory, robotics, and certainly deep/reinforcement learning.

I study, build, and use robots, and I design and tinker with AI-based control systems. You will find some of my videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnW4hJ4n0PY). I love working with talented teams, as well as spending-time with people in the knowledge-based industry[insert cerebral people]. I enjoy working in a multicultural team (_because, why not?_). I am an independent-minded researcher and I cherish being trusted to manage my own projects/goals rather than being given tasks and being micro-managed. Matter-of-factly, my best works have arisen out of the place of independence and self-management. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse discipline expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span history to public affairs (_really?_) to the sciences, and technology.
I am a big believer in open science and reproducible research. Therefore most of my papers and codes can be easily found on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JeUaqqEAAAAJ&hl=en) and my [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). I am particularly mindful of inclusion in hi-tech, STEM, policy-making, and governance (yep, all of the above). **Lekan is not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is **03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE  1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5**. It helps to send your email encrypted if I do not know you, to hasten a quick reply.  I have been described as quite an active tweeter; my handle is [@patmeansnoble](https://twitter.com/patmeansnoble).

<!-- I was ~~buttered and bread~~ born and bred in Southern Nigeria. I spent most of my adolescent and adult years in the only logical place in the whole wide world where one can maximize one's 'life-fun-index': [**whispers**][Lagos, Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos). I speak and write fluently in the [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English Languages -- languages I have spoken and used throughout my entire life. I once lived in Northern Nigeria, so I do understand some Hausa and teeny bits of Arabic -- though I do admit that most of it has slipped from my understanding. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic fluency of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese; I am currently working on a wizard-level proficiency. I love to meet people from other cultures and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human race. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese-Afro Jazz, and alternative rock music. I recently acquired an electric guitar (at [Ochanomizu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu)), which I am learning to play. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_). -->

#### Research, you say?

My work explores better model representation in dynamical systems using state-of-the-art neural network function approximators, for example in adaptive control or model predictive control of complex nonlinear systems. My background is in Physics and Control theory and I spend my PhD research exploring better ways of automating motion alignment correction systems in clinical cancer radiotherapy of malignant cancers of the head and neck region. The novelty of my work includes (i) the design and use of soft robots with morphological computation properties to dynamically adjust patient motion along desired degrees of freedom during cancer radiotherapy treatment; (ii) leveraging Cosserat's beam theory, Luh's algorithm, the forward and backward Euler methods, and screw theory for the kinodynamic planning and execution of trajectories by these soft and semi-rigid continuum robots -->

#### Research Background

In stereotactic radiosurgery of the head and neck region, patients are typically positioned in a supine manner on a 6-DOF robotic couch for motion alignment correction with respect to an incident radiation. As such, the precision of delivery of radiation dose to target tumor is extremely important. Target miss in dosimetry angle or errors arising from patient positioning have been known to cause eczema, brain complications, and the exposure of organs at risks.

To prevent the patient from drifting from pre-calibrated pose on the 6-DOF robotic treatment couch, clinicians fixate metallic rings/frames, or elastic plastic masks on the patient's head and neck region so that involuntary motion by the patient is greatly minimized. But the use of such rings or masks have undesirable effects such as attenuating the radiation beam (thus minimizing incident dose and treatment efficacy), or making the patient uncomfortable.
The majority of such masks employed do not compensate for real-time patient deviation from planned targets. To compensate for such drifts, I proposed a [neuro-adaptive controller][iros-paper] for a network of compliant soft-robot systems to automatically move the patient's head and neck to desired pose based on a learning based finite-state machine.

The idea is that by actuating elastomeric polymer enclosures that inflate or deflate based on the amount of air that is sent into them or by the amount of pressure that is exerted on them by a human-body part (such as the head or neck), one can achieve a desired level of pose in frameless or maskless radiotherapy without sacrificing patient comfort or treatment efficacy as existing technologies allow. -->

#### More perambulations

+   I work on problems with bandwidth spanning conception, build, and test of what I call "fancy little robots". I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

#### Name Etymology

People often ask me how to pronounce my name, and its meaning. Here we go:

+ Lekan is the short form of "Olalekan", which literally means "wealth increased by a factor of one" in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a (Benin-Congo) language of the [Yoruba people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) of West Africa.

+ Lekan is pronounced "Lay-con", or "Lay-kañ", where "añ" is akin to the intonation of "ION" in say, "captION".  

+ My last name is rather a little long-winding to roll on the tongue. But let me deconstruct its meaning first. From what I understand, my paternal ancestors
migrated from the Delta area of Nigeria (Warri, specifically) to Yorubaland many generations ago. They fully assimilated into the local Yoruba culture, and became part [Ifá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%C3%A1) divinators, and part [Ogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogun)  worshippers to boot (it is rather amusing that I chose the Engineering profession given that Ogun is generally worshipped by blacksmiths and technologists); "molu" is a compressed form of "mu olu", often abbreviated as "m'olu" or "molu" in contemporary Yoruba; it means "to take victory" or something of that facsimile. If you're catching my drift already, you'll see where this is going: Ogunmolu means "the god of iron prevailed". It's altogether pronounced as "O-goon-moe-loo". There you go.


+   When I am not busy, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), the [ros answers forum](http://answers.ros.org) or the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

+   Among the places I call home include Lagos, Nigeria; Sheffield, United Kingdom; Boston, MA; and of course Tokyo, Japan.
