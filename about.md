Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, studying **control systems**. My advisor is [**Nick Gans**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

When I am not in the lab or with my family, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), on [ros.org forum](http://answers.ros.org) or on the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

My [**academic webpage**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~opo140030/) has much more details on my academic research and publications.
