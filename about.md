Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, studying **control systems**. My advisor is [**Nick Gans**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

When I am not in the lab or with my family, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), on [ros.org](http://answers.ros.org) or on the [pytorch forum](discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

My [**academic webpage**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~opo140030/) has much more details on my academic research and publications.

#### Favorite Quotes

I love poetry and prose. Below are some of my favorite zingers and quotes.

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
                      -- Richard Feynman

>"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though chequered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither suffer much nor enjoy much,  because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat."
                      -- Theodore Roosevelt, 1910

> "It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? "
                      -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

> "In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away â€”
For the Snark was a Boojum, you see."
                      -- The Hunter's Snark, Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson)

> "However long the night, morning will come."
                      -- Bob Gass

> "Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored."
                      -- Abraham Lincoln

> "I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the strong, and neither is bread to the wise nor riches to those of intelligence and understanding nor favor to men of ability; but time and chance overtake them all."
                      -- Solomon

> "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to do all which may achieve and cherish: a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."                      
                      -- Abraham Lincoln
