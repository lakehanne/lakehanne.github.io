Welcome to my web presence, where theory meets practice, and where scientific elegance meets creative practical impact.

I am a roboticist (ML/Control specialist) with strong research thrusts in translational medical physics research. For the last 12 years, I have worked in several aspects of the automation research and development value chain in various capacities: this includes the consumer robots, supply chain, and process automation industries (Amazon Robotics, PFN Inc Japan, Coca-Cola). As a PhD (UT Dallas, UTSW) and a Postdoc (UChicago, UPenn), I explored open-ended questions in head and neck immobilization during photon-based head and neck surgery and magnetic resonance imaging -- with soft and rigid parallel robots alike. These create a niche skill-set that spans machine learning, control and motion-planning that improve partnership with teams and external vendors. 

Matter-of-factly, so far, the body of my research contributions have spanned approximate dynamic programming, robust optimal control/reinforcement learning, adaptive control, and soft robot hardware design, a little flavor of computer vision and optimal state estimation, as well as robot manipulation -- which I engaged in on two internships in industry.  During my time at UChicago and Penn, I proposed a Cephalopods-inpired parallel soft robot for improving photon-based radiation therapy cancer treatments in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereo-tactic radiosurgery, and emerging magnetic resonance+linear accelerator systems. Some of these details are covered in my [Winter 2021 Johnson and Johnson Talk](/assets/presentations/AurisHealth.pdf). In essence, from 30,000ft above, this is my message: I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, developing definitions, exposition, and critical insight -- all towards real-world impactful technological solutions. I love synergizing concepts from disparate fields, and then develop algorithms and analyses which ultimately lead to the solution. The opportunity to feast on ideas -- to investigate the physics behind machines and to understand the interconnectedness of components, hear people's opinions, see their arguments' flaws, and to improvise upon them to find better solutions is an essential component of my thought-actions. I enjoy managing by positive influence.


I regularly peer-review for [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/) , [IROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Robots_and_Systems), [American Control Conference](https://acc2021.a2c2.org/),  [International Federation of Automatic Control](https://www.ifac-control.org/) -- World Congress and Automatica alike, [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra), [ICML](https://icml.cc/),  [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/), IEEE Access, and [Neural Computing and Applications](https://www.springer.com/journal/521) among others. Last winter, I was Associate Editor for the Soft Robotics track at ICRA 2021.

## Continuum Mechanics Jovial Trivia

Welcome to my web presence: the material, the referential, the spatial, and the relative!

**Material Description**

I am an interdisciplinary researcher who combines the scientific elegance of **machine learning** and **control theory** with the practical impact of **robotics** to create technological solutions that improve radiation delivery for cancer patients.  

**Spatial Description: Placements**

**Eulerian Placement**: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Wiersma lab at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/) and I was previously with the group at [UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/). Here, I am foraging for knowledge and understanding. <i>Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas!</i>

**Lagrangean Placement**: During my [PhD]( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html), I was co-advised by [Steve Jiang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html) in the Medical Physics and Engineering program at [UT Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu) and [Nick Gans](https://utdallas.edu/~ngans) in the Electrical Engineering program at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).



**Backtracking through time**: I was ~~bread and buttered~~ bred and brought up in Southwest Nigeria. I've found my academic pursuits have driven me far from home in the last two decades. Many years ago, I was part of [Sheffield ACSE](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse). There, I was mentored in robotics by [Tony Dodd](http://www.catch.org.uk/team-member/prof-tony-dodd/). Prior to that, I had my Bachelors in Physics with a minor in Electronics. My thesis was on the single [fractional parentage coefficients](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.527930) in the sd-shell nuclei, advised by [Ademola Amusa](https://prabook.com/web/ademola.amusa/473412). 

**Current Configuration:** I work on problems spanning conceptualization of new hardware  and software tools for improving the **treatment planning** process in **cancer radiation therapy**. I am largely an independent researcher who enjoys self-direction at my own projects/goals. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span the sciences, technical disciplines (hello, chemistry, physics and engineering) to history and public affairs (really?). A big believer in open science and reproducible research, I try to make my publications and codes public to the extent that I can: see my [publications page](/pubs) and  [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). **I am not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is 03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE 1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5.  If you are ~~Russian and you would like to collude~~ a researcher and you would like to collaborate, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> me.


**Referential Description**: On the Origin and Wanderings of this Specie

I speak and write fluently in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English -- languages I have used throughout my entire life. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic understanding of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese. I am working on a working-level proficiency (still another mile!). I love to meet people from other places and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human culture. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese Jazz, and alternative rock music genres. I do have an electric guitar, which I lazily play when I'm depressed. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_).
<!-- I do have a base electric guitar I've played so hard that my forearm went through the drum. This led my acquaintance to suggest to me that I might benefit from going to a therapist, whom I visited. First session with the therapist, I was asked what my purpose was for being there. I told her I was angry at the world and its people.  -->
At various times in my little time on this planet, I have been a [_Shikaakwaan_](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), a _[Lagosian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian)_, a _[Sheffielder](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder) (home of my forever friends)_, a _Bostonian_, a _Londoner_, an _[Edokko](https://web-japan.org/tokyo/know/edokko/edo.html)_,  and a  _[Dallasite](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2012/01/are-we-dallasites-or-dallasonians-fort-worthers-or-fort-worthians-etymology-tells-us-who-we-are/) (Eh!)_.  

#### Miscellaneous

<!-- +   I like to think I take a lot of pain in my duties since I do derive pleasures in them. Each day, I gird my loins with strength and apply myself to my work: I lay my hand to the spindle and my hands hold to the distaff (like the proverbial virtuous woman :-) ).  To the end that when I am old and tired, I shall be able to reflect with comfort that I was not idle or useless when I was young. -->

+ I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

+ ~~I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group. We fly our drones, micro-UAVs, and mini-planes around the DFW area every Saturday just to disturb the peace and quiet of boring citizens.~~ I am no longer active with this group.

+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students, and occasionally high school students that are interested in computer vision, control, and robotics.

Outside of research, I am a cyclist, a runner, an hiker, and my friends tell me that I am an encourager. I did not start competitive cycling (mountain-biking) since about 2011. I graduated myself to road bikes in 2014. I've been part of various cycling clubs through the years, notably the [University of Sheffield Cycling Club](https://www.sport-sheffield.com/clubs/cycling), , [Plano Cycling Club](https://planobicycle.org/) and the [University of Chicago Velo Club](https://www.uchicagovelo.com/) among others.  When running, I mostly stick to 5 and 10k’s either with my friends at [Somerville road runners](https://www.srr.org/), [Frisco running club](https://friscorunningclub.com/) or alone. Whether I am running, cycling or back-packing, my happy place is time out in Mother Earth, marveling in creation's grand design.
