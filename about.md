### Intro

<!-- > _It is assumed that the reader speaks rational continuum mechanics._ -->

Welcome to my web presence: the material, the referential, the spatial, and the relative<sup></sup>! 

#### Material Description: Tell me what you got

I am an interdisciplinary researcher who combines the scientific elegance of **machine learning** and **control theory** with the practical impact of **robotics** to create technological solutions that improve radiation delivery for cancer patients.  

#### Spatial Description: Present _placement_ of this body

**Eulerian Placement**: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Wiersma lab at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/) and I was previously with the group at [UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/).

**Lagrangean Placement**: During my [PhD]( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html), I was co-advised by [Steve Jiang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html) in the Medical Physics and Engineering program at [UT Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu) and [Nick Gans](https://utdallas.edu/~ngans) in the Electrical Engineering program at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). 

**Backtrack through time**: Many years ago, before my PhD,  I was part of [Sheffield ACSE](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse). There, I was mentored in robotics by [Tony Dodd](http://www.catch.org.uk/team-member/prof-tony-dodd/). Prior to that, I had my Bachelors in Physics with a minor in Electronics. My thesis was on the single [fractional parentage coefiicients](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.527930) in the sd-shell nuclei, advised by [Ademola Amusa](https://prabook.com/web/ademola.amusa/473412). 

**Current Configuration:** I work on problems spanning conceptualization of new hardware  and software tools for improving the **treatment planning** process in **cancer radiation therapy**. I am largely an independent researcher who enjoys self-direction at my own projects/goals. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span the sciences, technical disciplines (hello, chemistry, physics and engineering) to history and public affairs (really?). A big believer in open science and reproducible research, I try to make my publications and codes public to the extent that I can: see my [publications page](/pubs) and  [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). **I am not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is 03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE 1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5.  If you are ~~Russian and you would like to collude~~ researcher and you would like to collaborate, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> me.


#### **Referential Description**: On the Origin and Wanderings of this Specie

I speak and write fluently in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English -- languages I have used throughout my entire life. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic understanding of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese. I am working on a working-level proficiency (still another mile!). I love to meet people from other places and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human culture. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese Jazz, and alternative rock music genres. I do have an electric guitar, which I lazily play when I'm depressed. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_).
There are many places I call home including [Chicago](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), [Lagos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian),  [Sheffield](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder), and Boston. 
At various times in my little time on this planet, I have been a [_Shikaakwaan_](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), a _[Lagosian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian)_, a _[Sheffielder](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder) (home of my forever friends)_, a _Bostonian_, a _Londoner_, an _[Edokko](https://web-japan.org/tokyo/know/edokko/edo.html)_,  and a  _[Dallasite](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2012/01/are-we-dallasites-or-dallasonians-fort-worthers-or-fort-worthians-etymology-tells-us-who-we-are/) (Eh!)_.  


#### Miscellaneous

+   I like to think I take a lot of pain in my duties since I do derive pleasures in them. Each day, I gird my loins with strength and apply myself to my work: I lay my hand to the spindle and my hands hold to the distaff (like the proverbial virtuous woman :-) ).  To the end that when I am old and tired, I shall be able to reflect with comfort that I was not idle or useless when I was young.

+ I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

+ ~~I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group. We fly our drones, micro-UAVs, and mini-planes around the DFW area every Saturday just to disturb the peace and quiet of boring citizens.~~ I am no longer active with this group.

+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students, and occasionally high school students that are interested in computer vision, control, and robotics.

<!-- + I still consider Sheffield my adopted home. Biggest village in Yorkshire, where I've made some of my biggest mistakes; where I've met some of the best people I could ever hope to know. City of hills. Home of the Yorkshire pudding. Of thee I sing!
#### Name Etymology

People often ask me how to pronounce my name, and its meaning. Here we go:

+ Lekan is the short form of "Olalekan", which literally means "wealth increased by a factor of one" in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a (Benin-Congo) language of the [Yoruba people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) of West Africa.

+ Lekan is pronounced "Lay-con", or "Lay-kañ", where "añ" is akin to the intonation of "ION" in say, "captION".  

+ My last name is rather a little long-winding to roll on the tongue. But let me deconstruct its meaning first. From what I understand, my paternal ancestors
migrated from the Delta area of Nigeria (Warri, specifically) to Yorubaland many generations ago. They fully assimilated into the local Yoruba culture, and became part [Ifá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%C3%A1) divinators, and part [Ogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogun)  worshippers to boot (it is rather amusing that I chose the Engineering profession given that Ogun is generally worshipped by blacksmiths and technologists); "molu" is a compressed form of "mu olu", often abbreviated as "m'olu" or "molu" in contemporary Yoruba; it means "to take victory" or something of that facsimile. If you're catching my drift already, you'll see where this is going: Ogunmolu means "the god of iron prevailed". It's altogether pronounced as "O-goon-moh-loo". There you go.


+   When I am not busy, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), the [ros answers forum](http://answers.ros.org) or the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

+   Among the places I call home include Lagos, Nigeria; Sheffield, United Kingdom; Boston, MA; and of course Tokyo, Japan.
