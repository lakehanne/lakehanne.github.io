Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

When I am not busy, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), the [ros.org forum](http://answers.ros.org) or the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.
