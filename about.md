I am an interdisciplinary engineer who combines experience in telecommunications and organizational management with academic training in physics and control systems. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Texas, studying Control Systems (mostly nonlinear dynamical systems), with a pinch in Computer Vision. My research interests foray into Switching in Systems and Controls, Stability of Switched Systems, Networked multi-agent systems, Machine Learning, and Fault Diagnosis/Fault-Tolerant control.

My [academic blog](http://lakehanne.github.io) has much more details. I do my other petty blogging [here](http://fancylittlerobots.blogspot.com).
