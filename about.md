<img src="/downloads/Pat.jpg" alt="Me" align="right" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
I am an interdisciplinary engineer who combines experience in telecommunications and organizational management with academic training in physics and control systems. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, studying **control systems** (mostly nonlinear dynamical systems), with a dab into computer vision. My advisor is [**Nick Gans**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). 

Prior to this, I had my _**Master of Science in Engineering**_ at the **University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England** where I majored in **control systems** under the advisement of [**Tony J. Dodd**](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/staff/tjd). 
I had my bachelors with a double major in **Physics** and **Electronics** from **Adekunle Ajasin University**  in Nigeria. My senior thesis (_Single-Fractional Parentage Coefficients in the sd-Shell Nuclei_) was advised by [**Ademola Amusa**](http://prabook.org/web/person-view.html?profileId=473412). 

My research interests include  _`adaptive system identification for control`_, _`computer vision`_, _`stability in switched systems and controls`_,  and _`machine learning`_. 

My [academic blog](http://lakehanne.github.io) has much more details on my research. More details on my background here on my [**Academic CV**](/downloads/resume/Resume_Work.pdf). A shorter version is distilled in my [**Short Resume**](/downloads/resume/Resume_ORD.pdf).

_`Gentle Bloke`_. _`Juxtaposed between introverted and extroverted`_. _`Lover of Pun`_. _`Seeker of Truth`_. _`Science Guy`_. _`Teacher to some`_. _`Student of many`_. 

<br></br>
_`iCycle`_, _`iSwim`_ & _`iSkate`_ -- _`in that order`_. _`Pop`_, _`soft rock`_, _`and`_ _`light metal`_ _`make the world go round`_.
