Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, studying **control systems**. My advisor is [**Nick Gans**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

When I am not in the lab or with my family, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), on [ros.org forum](http://answers.ros.org) or on the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

My [**academic webpage**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~opo140030/) has much more details on my academic research and publications.

> "There are several ways in which a mathematician can
proceed to extend his research efforts, particularly one who
is deeply interested in problems arising from the physical
world. He can, on one hand, examine the equations he has
been working with and modify them in a variety of ways.
Or he can ask questions that have not been asked before
concerning the nature of the solution of the original equations.
This is basically a very difficult way to carry out
research. It is very easy to change the form of an equation
in a large number of ways. The great majority of the
new equations are not meaningful, and, in consequence,
lead to both difficult and unimportant problems. Similarly,
there are many questions that are difficult to answer, but
hardly worth asking. The well-trained mathematician does
not measure the value of a problem solely by its intractability.
The challenge is there, but even very small boys do not
accept all dares."

> "Math is not something boys are better at, it's not a spectator sport, it's not a system of arbitrary rules, it's not dependent on the laws of physics, it's not easier or better in base 12 or base π, it's not a young man's game, it's not useless in the real world, it's not beholden to the real world, it's not learnable in one year or from one book or one website, it is not particularly interested in the golden ratio or the digits of pi or trivial calculation tricks that aren't actually from the Vedas, it is not always explainable to a 6-year-old or in "layman's terms", it's not beyond your grasp if you recognize that it will take time and dedication and active effort, it is not dry, it is not cold, it is not boring, it is not the opposite of "human" or "people-oriented" or "spiritual" or "artistic", and for Pete's sake, it doesn't say that if you add 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 "and so on" you'll "in the end" get 1/12."

> “The trick that one learns over time, a basic part of mathematical methodology,
is to sidestep the equation and focus instead on the structure of the underlying
physical process. One learns to submit oneself to a catechism: ‘When I set up
these equations originally, I made certain assumptions. How realistic were these
assumptions? What state variables, and what effects did I ignore?'' ...In the real
world, none of these assumptions are uniformly valid. Often people want to know
why mathematics and computers cannot be used to handle the meaningful problems
of society, as opposed, let us say, to the moon boondoggle and high energy–high
cost physics. The answer lies in the fact that we don’t know how to describe the
complex systems of society involving people, we don’t understand cause and effect,
which is to say the consequences of decisions, and we don’t even know how to make our
objectives reasonably precise. None of the requirements of classical science are
met.""

> "He was very clear that entering a new field always meant discomfort. It was hard to raise money to do an experiment, and the existing experts would resent your entry. He told me that the only way to do it was with complete humility; you had to recognize that you didn't know much. You have to become a student again. No shortcuts. Before you talk to any of the experts, study hard so that they won't feel that you are wasting their time. If you can bring something new to an existing field, then you might make an important discovery."

>"Johnny von Neumann was a great mathematician and a great physicist. So someone (I don't remember who) challenged him with this problem: Two trains are 100 meters apart, moving towards each other. Each train is moving at 10 meters per second.  A bee is flying back and forth between those two trains at 20 meters per second. Eventually the bee will be squished when the two trains crash against each other. When they do, what will be the total distance flown by the bee?

>According to legend, von Neumann thought for a moment, and then said "100 meters".

>The questioner said, "Correct. But now I know, from the quickness of your response, that you are really a physicist, not a mathematician.  The mathematician would have calculated when each bee-train encounter takes place, calculated the position, taken the sum of those distances as an infinite series, and then summed the series.  But a physicist would have taken a short-cut; the physicists would have realized that the bee was flying for 5 seconds at 20 meters per second, so it would have traveled 100 meters total."

>Von Neumann's purported response: "Oh, that's a clever way to solve it!  No, I summed the series."
