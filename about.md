[Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.url }}/downloads/Resume_Work.pdf).

I am an interdisciplinary engineer who combines experience in telecommunications and organizational management with academic training in physics and control systems. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas**, studying **control systems** (mostly nonlinear dynamical systems), with a pinch in computer vision being advised by [Nick Gans](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). 

Prior to this, I had my *Master of Science in Engineering* at the **University of Sheffield** in England where I majored in **control systems** under the advisement of [Tony J. Dodd](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse/staff/tjd).
My research interests foray into _`stability in switched systems and controls`_, `_networked multi-agent systems_`, `_machine learning_`, and _`fault diagnosis/fault-tolerant control`_.

My [academic blog](http://lakehanne.github.io) has much more details on my research. I do my other petty blogging [here](http://fancylittlerobots.blogspot.com). 



Hobbies: iCycle, iSkate, & iSwim.
