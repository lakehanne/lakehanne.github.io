Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas at Dallas**, studying **control systems**. My advisor is [**Nick Gans**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~ngans/). Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

When I am not in the lab or with my family, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), on [ros.org forum](http://answers.ros.org) or on the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

My [**academic webpage**](http://www.utdallas.edu/~opo140030/) has much more details on my academic research and publications.

> "Math is not something boys are better at, it's not a spectator sport, it's not a system of arbitrary rules, it's not dependent on the laws of physics, it's not easier or better in base 12 or base π, it's not a young man's game, it's not useless in the real world, it's not beholden to the real world, it's not learnable in one year or from one book or one website, it is not particularly interested in the golden ratio or the digits of pi or trivial calculation tricks that aren't actually from the Vedas, it is not always explainable to a 6-year-old or in "layman's terms", it's not beyond your grasp if you recognize that it will take time and dedication and active effort, it is not dry, it is not cold, it is not boring, it is not the opposite of "human" or "people-oriented" or "spiritual" or "artistic", and for Pete's sake, it doesn't say that if you add 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 "and so on" you'll "in the end" get 1/12."

> "It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? "

> "In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
In the midst of his laughter and glee,
He had softly and suddenly vanished away —
For the Snark was a Boojum, you see."

> "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to do all which may achieve and cherish: a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."                      
                      -- Abraham Lincoln
