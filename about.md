I am an interdisciplinary engineer who combines experience in telecommunications and organizational management with academic training in physics and control systems. I am currently a PhD student at the **University of Texas**, studying **control systems** (mostly nonlinear dynamical systems), with a pinch in computer vision. Prior to this, I had my *Masters of Science in Engineering* at the **University of Sheffield** in England where I majored in **control systems**.

My research interests foray into _`stability in switched systems and controls`_, `_networked multi-agent systems_`, `_machine learning_`, and _`fault diagnosis/fault-tolerant control`_.

My [academic blog](http://lakehanne.github.io) has much more details on my research. I do my other petty blogging [here](http://fancylittlerobots.blogspot.com).
