## Intro

> _It is assumed that the reader speaks [rational continuum mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-Rational-Continuum-Mechanics/dp/1483207056)._

Welcome to my web presence: the material, the referential, the spatial, and the relative! 

**Material Description**

I am an interdisciplinary researcher who combines the scientific elegance of **machine learning** and **control theory** with the practical impact of **robotics** to create technological solutions that improve radiation delivery for cancer patients.  

**Spatial Description: Placements**

**Eulerian Placement**: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Wiersma lab at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/) and I was previously with the group at [UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/). Here, I am foraging for knowledge and understanding. <i>Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas!</i>

**Lagrangean Placement**: During my [PhD]( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html), I was co-advised by [Steve Jiang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html) in the Medical Physics and Engineering program at [UT Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu) and [Nick Gans](https://utdallas.edu/~ngans) in the Electrical Engineering program at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).

 

**Backtracking through time**: Many years ago, I was part of [Sheffield ACSE](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse). There, I was mentored in robotics by [Tony Dodd](http://www.catch.org.uk/team-member/prof-tony-dodd/). Prior to that, I had my Bachelors in Physics with a minor in Electronics. My thesis, on the single [fractional parentage coefficients](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.527930) in the sd-shell nuclei, was advised by [Prof. Ademola Amusa](https://prabook.com/web/ademola.amusa/473412). 

**Current Configuration:** I work on problems spanning conceptualization of new hardware  and software tools for improving the **treatment planning** process in **cancer radiation therapy**. I am largely an independent researcher who enjoys self-direction at my own projects/goals. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span the sciences, technical disciplines (hello, chemistry, physics and engineering) to history and public affairs (really?). A big believer in open science and reproducible research, I try to make my publications and codes public to the extent that I can: see my [publications page](/pubs) and  [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). **I am not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is 03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE 1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5.  If you are ~~Russian and you would like to collude~~ a researcher and you would like to collaborate, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> me.


**Referential Description**: On the Origin and Wanderings of this Specie

I speak and write fluently in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English -- languages I have used throughout my entire life. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic understanding of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese. I am working on a working-level proficiency (still another mile!). I love to meet people from other places and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human culture. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese Jazz, and alternative rock music genres. I do have an electric guitar, which I lazily play when I'm depressed. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_). 
<!-- I do have a base electric guitar I've played so hard that my forearm went through the drum. This led my acquaintance to suggest to me that I might benefit from going to a therapist, whom I visited. First session with the therapist, I was asked what my purpose was for being there. I told her I was angry at the world and its people.  -->
At various times in my little time on this planet, I have been a [_Shikaakwaan_](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), a _[Lagosian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian)_, a _[Sheffielder](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder) (home of my forever friends)_, a _Bostonian_, a _Londoner_, an _[Edokko](https://web-japan.org/tokyo/know/edokko/edo.html)_,  and a  _[Dallasite](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2012/01/are-we-dallasites-or-dallasonians-fort-worthers-or-fort-worthians-etymology-tells-us-who-we-are/) (Eh!)_.  


Outside of research, I am a cyclist, a runner, an hiker, and my friends tell me that I am an encourager. I started cycling since I was about 11; I did not start competitive cycling (mountain-biking) since about 2011. I graduated myself to road bikes in 2014. I've been part of various cycling clubs through the years, notably the [University of Sheffield Cycling Club](https://www.sport-sheffield.com/clubs/cycling), , [Plano Cycling Club](https://planobicycle.org/) and the [University of Chicago Velo Club](https://www.uchicagovelo.com/) among others.  When running, I mostly stick to 5 and 10kâ€™s either with my friends at [Somerville road runners](https://www.srr.org/), [Frisco running club](https://friscorunningclub.com/) or alone. So whether I am running, cycling or back-packing, my happy place is meditating in mother nature about creation's grand design, or being in the company of a quiet, and humble people (thanks to my church famalam).

<!-- #### Miscellaneous -->

<!-- +   I like to think I take a lot of pain in my duties since I do derive pleasures in them. Each day, I gird my loins with strength and apply myself to my work: I lay my hand to the spindle and my hands hold to the distaff (like the proverbial virtuous woman :-) ).  To the end that when I am old and tired, I shall be able to reflect with comfort that I was not idle or useless when I was young. -->

+ I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

+ ~~I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group. We fly our drones, micro-UAVs, and mini-planes around the DFW area every Saturday just to disturb the peace and quiet of boring citizens.~~ I am no longer active with this group.

+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students, and occasionally high school students that are interested in computer vision, control, and robotics.
