Welcome to my blog, where theory meets practice. I am all about transforming scientific elegance into cool engineering impact. Fields that consume the bulk of my attention currently include control theory, deep learning, robotics and certainly reinforcement learning.

My work explores better model representation in dynamical systems using state-of-the-art neural network function approximators to determine accurate system models, for example in adaptive control or model predictive control of complex nonlinear systems. My background is in Physics and Control theory and I spend my PhD research exploring better ways of automating motion alignment correction systems in clinical cancer radiotherapy of malignant cancers of the head and neck region. The novelty of my work includes (i) the design and use of soft robots with morphological computation properties to dynamically adjust patient motion along desired degrees of freedom during cancer radiotherapy treatment; (ii) adaptive function approximators to model these coupled nonlinearities.  As these soft actuators are nonlinear, a lot of effort goes into formulating the model properties of the hardware in order to obtain an effective controller that can deliver the required sub-millimeter and sub-degree accuracy. Owing to the recent advances in sequential deep learning frameworks in terms of their accuracy and precision in generating powerful models for tasks including speech recognition and machine language translation, I leverage on these technologies to create dynamic models of the patient testbed and to design appropriate adaptive controllers to scale.


### Things I do for fun

+ I am a co-owner of the Linux, OpenStack and Unix Networking video tutorials on [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-0PMn0rKV_ZOHF-qX6N3fQ/videos) youtube page.

+ I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group.  

+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students and high school students that are interested in computer vision and robotics. Two of them are currently working in industry. 

+ I enjoy cycling with my little man in the shortly-before-dusk hours around my neighborhood.

+ When I am not busy, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), the [ros.org forum](http://answers.ros.org) or the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.
