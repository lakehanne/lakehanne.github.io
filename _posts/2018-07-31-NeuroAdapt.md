It's been more than a year since my last post. I am sorry. I blame the publish or perish academic mantra. Now that I've stocked up on a few more papers, I shall try to keep up to date elucidating topics that capture my imagination right here.

This post deals with understanding the the role of neural networks in adaptive control theory. It is a talk Nick gave on my behalf at Google Robotics last year. The neural network adaptive control part starts on the 11th slide.

For completeness sake, I am attaching the full slides here. It does more justice to the subject than I could ever rewrite in markdown :). Enjoy and feel free to ask questions in the comments section!
