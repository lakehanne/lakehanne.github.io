This post deals with understanding the the role of neural networks in adaptive control theory. It is mostly based on my oral presentation at 2017 IROS and at Google Robotics, Mountain View, California.

For completeness sake, I am attaching the full slides here. It does more justice to the subject than I could ever rewrite in markdown :). Enjoy!
