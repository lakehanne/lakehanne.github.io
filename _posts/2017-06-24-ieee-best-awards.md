Through the looking-glass, tired of working my brain out while familiarizing myself with a giant codebase I was reverse-engineering to prove a theory for an upcoming conference, I started asking myself why I was doing what I was doing? Just to get a paper out? Or to make a great contribution to science and my field? I googled something along the lines of "_How to write a best IEEE RAS conference paper_". What I found was very interesting as I came across this [IEEE Student Activities Committee Paper][ieee-sac]. It offers
great insight into what constitutes writing a paper that merits IEEE Robotics and Automation Society best conference awards.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.
