Finally porting over to the sexy github.io webpages.

This site is built and maintained with [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
It keeps all my static blog pages locally on my computer and github repo instead of being stashed somewhere on a remote site I have no control over. 

Inspired by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) .
