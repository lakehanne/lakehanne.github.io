Finally porting over to the much more sexier github.io webpages.

This site is built and maintained with [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/). It keeps all my static blog pages locally on my computer and github repo instead of being stashed at a remote site where I have no control. 

Inspired by [Tom Preston-Werner](tom.preston-werner.com].
