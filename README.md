Finally porting over to the much more sexier github.io webpages.

This site is built and maintained with [_**jekyll**_](https://jekyllrb.com/) and keeps all my static blog webpages locally on my computer/github repo instead of being stashed at a remote site I have no control over. 

Inspired by [Tom Preston-Werner](tom.preston-werner.com].
